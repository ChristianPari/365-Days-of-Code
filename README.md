Tonight's implementation of User Auth via JWT for routes that manipulate my DB<br>
Really starting to see the power of MongoDB and created a patch method in movie router to update specific properties and fields from the request body data

<h2>Day 100</h2>

Finally fixed compile error, once I dove in to React I began creation of a Todo List app. So far I have created multiple components, used props from main App component to change the state property from elements created with a deeper component<br>
Learned a lot tonight, but is also a lot to take in. The idea of a components ladder with structure and properties sounds amazing and can't wait to develope better skills and abilities with React.

<h2>Day 99</h2>

Spent time going over React documentation, watching videos and following along with code.<br>
For some reason after I create the react app from the terminal and try to run with npm, I get a compile error.. couldn't figure out why but plan to!

<h2>Day 98</h2>

Implemented the adminAuth and userAuth middlewares into my routers for the Movie Rental Site. AdminAuth ensures a user has admin capabilities and userAuth ensures the current user's JWT hasn't expired

<h2>Day 97</h2>

Worked with Movie Site, started developing admin authentication for routes that allow manipulation of the DB; logging in which stores a JWT for an hour (for testing), then using that Token through site to Auth a User 

<h2>Day 96</h2>

Created a middleware function that extracts a users ID from JSON Web Token to check if the user has admin capabilities on the music rental site. Also spent time helping a classmate debug an error which was good practice

<h2>Day 95</h2>

CLI Algoirthm practice with array and user input manipulation with use of for loops and RegExp.<br>
Continued work with JWT on movie rental site to create the Token in user login for authorization in further routes

<h2>Day 94</h2>

Successfully created the beginning process of a MEN Stack app, DB connected, working routes n requests made, mongo model made n one WIP, DB partially filled<br>
Really glad with my understanding of the backend environment<br>
Also continued research on React and will begin implementing it into an application this week!<br>
Understanding JS classes and React Components, along with what and how JSX is used to communicate to React to create a virtual DOM

<h2>Day 93</h2>

More research on JWT and Bcrypt, getting a better understanding of how to encrypt with hash and using JWT sign method to create a token!<br>
More work with recursion, starting to understand the process more clearly, how it evaluates the call stack

<h2>Day 92</h2>

Really trying to keep the algorithm practice a constant exercise each day! Today consisted all with array manipulation with the array being created from a single integer argument.<br>
"Think Computationally" is the goal<br>
Also spending a lot of time researching and reviewing documentation on JWT and Bcrypt, can't wait to really implement this into an application!

<h2>Day 91</h2>

Continued researching JSON Web Tokens and getting a good understanding of a tokens properties (header, payload, signature) and the process to encrypt using NodeJS bcrypt

<h2>Day 90</h2>

Dove straight into using bcrypt and jwt by implementing them into latest movie site for user account creation<br>
Bcrypt is great, generating salt and hashing a password to keep user data safe that's stored in the DB, more with JWT this weekend

<h2>Day 89</h2>

Realized yesterday that I was focusing a lot on Express Apps and lacking on algorithms/challenges to improve my coding knowledge and how I think computationally. So I spent today working with some algorithms and will be doing them more often

<h2>Day 88</h2>

Did some serious research and practice with recursion, and am beginning to really understand how powerful it is and how, when used correctly, can make algorithm solutions much cleaner<br>

<h2>Day 51</h2>

[Completed JS alg that used a loop to cycle through arrays to convert a number parameter to its roman numeral equivalent(]https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorthims/blob/master/intermediate%20alrogithms/convert_to_roman.js) Continued working with Java basics, this time work w/ Java array syntax/setup. Continued work with REST APIs and implemented all main CRUD methods into [my code](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/Full-Intro1), the syntax and how to setup these requests are really starting to click, can't wait to start MongoDB tomorrow!

<h2>Day 50</h2>

Completed an algorithm that used RegExp to remove all non 'alpha-numerics' and check if it's a [palindrome](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorthims/blob/master/intermediate%20alrogithms/palindrome_checker.js) Spent another hour and a half on another algorithm that has me stumped, will be spending more time on it tomorrow!

<h2>Day 49</h2>

More time on Java, [created my first public class and used its properties and methods to create new objects and manipulate its data within the Main class code block, practice with data type methods and numeric expressions.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-Java/commit/0ac4fcca81b42977572f09c18a59bf074c2d7190) Continued research and videos on MongoDB to get a good understanding of the syntax and how the data is created and stored. Also learned the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases which is cool!

<h2>Day 48</h2>

Continued work with Java, [learned about data types and classes (primitive, complex/objects)](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-Java/commit/f067d5a9bbbfb08839d9371983890bd11c8df611), understanding and noting the types of primitive data types and their differences, how to get user input using the Scanner class

<h2>Day 47</h2>

Started up [my first a Java repo on GitHub](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-Java), simply to learn the basics and programming syntax (for now). Began going over the documentation and a video for MongoDB to get an idea of what I'll be working with later this week!

<h2>Day 46</h2>

Completed FCC's Node Express Challenge/tutorial on [Glitch](http://Glitch.com/edit/#!/node-express-walkthrough), also finished up 
a [Mosh Hamedani YT video on RESTful APIs w/ Node](http://GitHub.com/christianpari/intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/REST-API-Walkthrough), going to finish with some research on the NPM package Joi

<h2>Day 45</h2>

[Continued working through FreeCodeCamps "Node and Express" walkthrough challenges to continue my learning and understanding of how the backend works](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/node-express-walkthrough)

<h2>Day 44</h2>

What a codeNight, [really dived deep into the backend tonight. Worked through the processes of using MIDDLEWARE, ROUTES via Express.Router method, serving STATIC files w/ Express, using a .txt file as a local DB and altering it w/ POST n GET!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/Full-Intro1)

<h2>Day 43</h2>

Watched a [Mosh Hamedani YT video on REST APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) and did the [walkthrough](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/Full-Intro1), starting to understand the different aspects of the request and response arguments within the callback function of the requests and how to access the data I need for each one

<h2>Day 42</h2>

[More diving into the backend with NPM, Express, Nodemon, and Dotenv. Nodemon is great, no need to rerun npm start while testing, starting to understand the components of express request methods and their syntax. And Dotenv is amazing for hiding sensitive data from the user! Got a walkthrough and tutorial to watch tomorrow that will hopefully help me get an even better understanding of all this!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/FirstNPM)

<h2>Day 41</h2>

Today was fully loaded, I achieved what I wanted functionality wise of [my project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API) so now I have both age and gender filters as well as the ability for the user to view posts from each fake user from the GoRest API, and began learning NPM!

<h2>Day 40</h2>

Implemented another filter into [my program](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API), this one lets the user give an age range that filters out users that aren't in the range. I made the gender filter global instead of by page so now the gender filter continues with each page change!

<h2>Day 39</h2>

Really happy with the progress I made with [this project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API) today, I implement a filter feature for gender for all the users within the GoRest API that I'm using for my webpage, tomorrow I plan on trying to implement a user inputted age range too

<h2>Day 38</h2>

Due to my high amount of coding time with projects and learning Java this week, my family time has been cut short so taking the day to hang with them but [I did finally start getting all my beginner code onto GitHub](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Learning-the-Basics), I'll add a new repo each day!

<h2>Day 37</h2>

FINALLY all thanks to my teacher for helping me figure out why we couldnt get a POST request to go through, authorization and Bearer tokens are what I learned about today. But also [finished up most recent API project!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API) More Java and Algorithms next

<h2>Day 36</h2>

Worked hours on the [latest project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API)
, trying to implement a POST request with user inputs and selected data. Did lots of research on understanding the request header data for API requests. Worked on updating my READMEs as well.

<h2>Day 35</h2>

Custom user snippets are amazing! Just stumbled upon the idea and made some today, so helpful. As for coding, I completed some [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms), spent more time on learning Java, and [completed a big portion of code on latest class project.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API)

<h2>Day 34</h2>

After failing to run Java within VSCode so I could practice while learning, I found a free Java compiler IDE online that'll be perfect! I finished the styling for [my last project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE), and class tonight we [started another with a different API!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API)

<h2>Day 33</h2>

Took me quite a while but I finally figured out and fixed an error in my [WIP project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE) with APIs, thank you Google for the help! Pushed some [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to my GitHub but am looking forward to styling/finishing up this most recent class project!

<h2>Day 32</h2>

The 30 Days Java was more than I could handle so instead I decided to go start the [SoloLearn course](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/16421537/Java) instead, getting a lot out of it, then I'll do the 30 Day again after! Started adding CSS to my current [project using CRUD](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE)

<h2>Day 31</h2>

Didn't get as much as I wanted down but am happy with my progress on my [newest project.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE) Allowing the user to make an edit on a post on the webpage and have the respective API request made depending on their inputs. CSS will be tomorrow's task

<h2>Day 30</h2>

Today's been a blast, started a 30 Day Java Challenge to begin learning Java, class tonight I learned how to use the [DELETE request method](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE), and am now getting some practice with Local Storage/Session Storage! Thankful for this blessing of code

<h2>Day 29</h2>

Spent hours working on a [project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20n%20PATCH) that allows the user to change post data by a form, then had to make code logic that allowed my program to determine wether to make a PATCH or PUT request to the API. Learned some new techniques today for sure

<h2>Day 28</h2>

Pused some [intermediate algorithms to GitHub](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorthims/tree/master/intermediate%20alrogithms), spent the night with the class learning about more API methods [PUT and PATCH.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/First%20Put-Patch%20Request) Have a good understanding of their similarities and differences, will be using JSONplaceholder API for a project tomorrow

<h2>Day 27</h2>

More of my favorite, learned about [POST requests today and in a small webpage played around with gathering user input and sending it through as a parameter in a XHR POST request.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/First%20Post%20Request) Tomorrow's plan is to learn about the other XHR methods, can't wait!

<h2>Day 26</h2>

[Finished the functionality of the weather webpage](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Weather%20Webpage), I've incorporated 3 APIs and used 4 different endpoints, this definitely was the most in depth JS project I've done with APIs! All that's left is CSS tomorrow before class

<h2>Day 25</h2>

Got one of the API requests for this [Weather project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Weather%20Webpage) complete with data being displayed on the DOM. Finding that sanitizing user input can be challenging, doing better at not repeating code. Finishing second request tomorrow, along with styling!

<h2>Day 24</h2>

Today I started another [Weather API project using multiple APIs](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Weather%20Webpage), this will have two UIs which allows users to get today's current weather anywhere in the world and another will allow them to get weather from the last 20 years from any location

<h2>Day 23</h2>

In the process of finishing up the styling of this [Historical Weather API](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Historical%20Weather), once done I'll be recreating it from scratch over the weekend and implementing another API into the code as well to get practice using more than one API source! 

<h2>Day 22</h2>

Worked more on the [Meteostat Historical Weather API project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Historical%20Weather), implemented a cancel button, and displayed the response data from the API to the DOM.

<h2>Day 20</h2>

Spent time with the CareerDevs squad using OpenWeathers' API for another webpage [project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Historical%20Weather). Learned how to use Array.from() method. Pushed some [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to GitHub earlier, but highlights of this week have absolutely been using APIs, loving them!

<h2>Day 19</h2>

[Added a weather condition icon from the API response to the DOM for each locations weather when searched, also implemented weather based images for each condition that would become the webpage background; showing = snowy background, loving APIs](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Current%20City%20Weather%20v1)

<h2>Day 18</h2>

Having a day with the family enjoying this beautiful weather but got some [algorithm practice in](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms), some used RegEx too, still have trouble making those work so practice is always good. Looking forward trying a grid calendar CSS/JS tomorrow tho!

<h2>Day 17</h2>

[Finsihed my first API project using Open Weathers' Current Weather API](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Current%20City%20Weather%20v1), allows user input for city name, country or zip code for us cities. Displays weather info to the DOM nearly but not styled much. Used and learned more on RegEx for this too.

<h2>Day 16</h2>

I spent time doing [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) and pushed some to GitHub. As a class we began creating the framework for our first [weather API project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Current%20City%20Weather%20v1). Began to understand the complexity of using user input with APIs! Going to complete this program over the weekend!

<h2>Day 15</h2>

Today was a light day, finished up the README and cleaned up my JS from yesterday's [project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/NASA/APOD_Insight). Worked on [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) for a couple hours

<h2>Day 14</h2>

Reworked my [NASA API project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/NASA/APOD_Insight) to fix all errors that were occurring and then also implemented a button to randomly request an APOD and have it display to the DOM. Worked with the cohort team tonight with CSS to get the DOM styled to our liking

<h2>Day 13</h2>

Got some good advice that company's want to see consistency and thorough documentation when viewing hirees GitHubs so I continued to update my READMEs. As for coding, spent the night with my class making another [webpage](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/NASA/APOD) w/ NASAs APOD API 

<h2>Day 12</h2>

Finished a [project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/NASA/APOD_Insight) that uses the idea behind my date navigation project but implemented NASA APIs: Mars Weather and APOD; user can change dates and background becomes APOD img from that day, and Mars Weather displays sol max min for last 7 days

<h2>Day 11</h2>

Started off with [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms), then updated more READMEs. Spent some time watching API videos; understanding the use of XHR better, and watched some vids on fetch. Started a layout for a functioning calendar project, and began work with a [NASA API](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/NASA/APOD)

<h2>Day 10</h2>

Today marked a halfway point to me overhauling my GitHub READMEs, seeing ones of established coders made me realize I wasn't putting in the effort like I should be. Spent some time watching vids on 'ASYNC vs SYNC' and APIs, and researching!

<h2>Day 9</h2>

Worked with APIs, just trying to really make sure I'm understanding how they work, starting to see the power behind using them! Need more research on ASYNC and SYNC. [Finished two small programs](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs), starting another tomorrow

<h2>Day 8</h2>

More work w/ APIs, [GitHubs Users](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/ThirdXHR) and [JSONplaceholder](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/FourthXHR) Users APIs both used in programs yesterday and today.

<h2>Day 7</h2>

Worked more with [XHR](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/ThirdXHR) and created; with CSS Grid (an amazing and powerful tool), a webpage that displays users and info about them using GitHub API as my endpoint. Worked on [v5 calendar program](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version005); pushed [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to GitHub

<h2>Day 6</h2>

Finished [v4](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version004) of the calendar project, v5 begins this week. Best part of day 6 is I started learning about API's! Did two simply programs ([1](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/FirstXHR), [2](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/SecondXHR)) to get acquainted with GET requests, onload, and send, and back to it tomorrow!

<h2>Day 5</h2>

Worked on [version4](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version004) of the CalendarNav project, used CSS to make it look more like a widget! Will finish the styling tomorrow. Going to work on version5 this week. Pushed more algorithms to GitHub as well.

<h2>Day 4</h2>

Finished JS portion of my [program v4](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version004), users can change dates via selects, make notes for selected date via prompt, hide/show notes created on the UI via buttons. Code is reusable for future programs. CSS is WIP

<h2>Day 3</h2>

Created new version of a simple [program](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version003) that allows a user to change dates via select elements, add some CSS. WIP of [version 4](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version004) that will allow the user to change dates, create notes on selected date and display on the UI.
 
<h2>Day 2</h2>

Finished a simple [program](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version002); allows users to select year, month, day w/ select elms and display it back on the DOM, then restart/refresh via onClick.
Pushed more [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to GitHub, and edited my [MovieRentalProject v3](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Movie_Rental/Personal_Work/Version003)

<h2>Day 1</h2>

Worked on a class [project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version001): allows a user to cycle thru dates using buttons. Then began a version2 using select elements. Back-end is almost there, front-end needs more work. Pushed a couple completed [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to GitHub as well
