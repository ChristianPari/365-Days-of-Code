<h2>Day 2</h2>

Finished a simple [program](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version002); allows users to select year, month, day w/ select elms and display it back on the DOM, then restart/refresh via onClick.
Pushed more [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to GitHub, and edited my [MovieRentalProject v3](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Movie_Rental/Personal_Work/Version003)

<h2>Day 1</h2>

Worked on a class [project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Pre-API-Projects/tree/master/Calendar_Navigation/Personal_Work/Version001): allows a user to cycle thru dates using buttons. Then began a version2 using select elements. Back-end is almost there, front-end needs more work. Pushed a couple completed [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to GitHub as well
