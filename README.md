<h2>Day 55</h2>
<h4>June 1, 2020</h4>

Recreated another server using a MongoDB Atlas cluster as the database, really want to make sure I have a really good understanding on how to setup a server, connect to an Atlas cluster, as well as syntax for using express and middleware in Node

<h2>Day 54</h2>
<h4>May 31, 2020</h4>

Worked w/MongoDB Atlas, created my a cluster and connected to my Node server! Implemented successful requests, but need to better understand the syntax. Continued w/ Java's List Interface, Objects, Classes, understanding OOP

<h2>Day 53</h2>
<h4>May 30, 2020</h4>

POST PATCH and DELETE reqs for this server project, all write/read my .txt DB file and updates. Either doing static files for the routes to have a front end display OR attempting to swap my .txt for MongoDB Atlas cluster

<h2>Day 52</h2>
<h4>May 29, 2020</h4>

Got MongoDB Compass installed and plan on trying to attempt creating a DB and using it my simple server project over this weekend. [So far I've installed all my packages, and created app.js, the root route and middleware](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/REST-API-v1)

<h2>Day 51</h2>
<h4>May 28, 2020</h4>

[Completed JS alg that used a loop to cycle through arrays to convert a number parameter to its roman numeral equivalent(]https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorthims/blob/master/intermediate%20alrogithms/convert_to_roman.js) Continued working with Java basics, this time work w/ Java array syntax/setup. Continued work with REST APIs and implemented all main CRUD methods into [my code](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/Full-Intro1), the syntax and how to setup these requests are really starting to click, can't wait to start MongoDB tomorrow!

<h2>Day 50</h2>
<h4>May 27, 2020</h4>

Completed an algorithm that used RegExp to remove all non 'alpha-numerics' and check if it's a [palindrome](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorthims/blob/master/intermediate%20alrogithms/palindrome_checker.js) Spent another hour and a half on another algorithm that has me stumped, will be spending more time on it tomorrow!

<h2>Day 49</h2>
<h4>May 26, 2020</h4>

More time on Java, [created my first public class and used its properties and methods to create new objects and manipulate its data within the Main class code block, practice with data type methods and numeric expressions.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-Java/commit/0ac4fcca81b42977572f09c18a59bf074c2d7190) Continued research and videos on MongoDB to get a good understanding of the syntax and how the data is created and stored. Also learned the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases which is cool!

<h2>Day 48</h2>
<h4>May 25, 2020</h4>

Continued work with Java, [learned about data types and classes (primitive, complex/objects)](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-Java/commit/f067d5a9bbbfb08839d9371983890bd11c8df611), understanding and noting the types of primitive data types and their differences, how to get user input using the Scanner class

<h2>Day 47</h2>
<h4>May 24, 2020</h4>

Started up [my first a Java repo on GitHub](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-Java), simply to learn the basics and programming syntax (for now). Began going over the documentation and a video for MongoDB to get an idea of what I'll be working with later this week!

<h2>Day 46</h2>
<h4>May 23, 2020</h4>

Completed FCC's Node Express Challenge/tutorial on [Glitch](http://Glitch.com/edit/#!/node-express-walkthrough), also finished up 
a [Mosh Hamedani YT video on RESTful APIs w/ Node](http://GitHub.com/christianpari/intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/REST-API-Walkthrough), going to finish with some research on the NPM package Joi

<h2>Day 45</h2>
<h4>May 22, 2020</h4>

[Continued working through FreeCodeCamps "Node and Express" walkthrough challenges to continue my learning and understanding of how the backend works](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/node-express-walkthrough)

<h2>Day 44</h2>
<h4>May 21, 2020</h4>

What a codeNight, [really dived deep into the backend tonight. Worked through the processes of using MIDDLEWARE, ROUTES via Express.Router method, serving STATIC files w/ Express, using a .txt file as a local DB and altering it w/ POST n GET!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/Full-Intro1)

<h2>Day 43</h2>
<h4>May 20, 2020</h4>

Watched a [Mosh Hamedani YT video on REST APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48) and did the [walkthrough](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/Full-Intro1), starting to understand the different aspects of the request and response arguments within the callback function of the requests and how to access the data I need for each one

<h2>Day 42</h2>
<h4>May 19, 2020</h4>

[More diving into the backend with NPM, Express, Nodemon, and Dotenv. Nodemon is great, no need to rerun npm start while testing, starting to understand the components of express request methods and their syntax. And Dotenv is amazing for hiding sensitive data from the user! Got a walkthrough and tutorial to watch tomorrow that will hopefully help me get an even better understanding of all this!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Intro-to-REST-APIs/tree/master/FirstNPM)

<h2>Day 41</h2>
<h4>May 18, 2020</h4>

Today was fully loaded, I achieved what I wanted functionality wise of [my project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API) so now I have both age and gender filters as well as the ability for the user to view posts from each fake user from the GoRest API, and began learning NPM!

<h2>Day 40</h2>
<h4>May 17, 2020</h4>

Implemented another filter into [my program](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API), this one lets the user give an age range that filters out users that aren't in the range. I made the gender filter global instead of by page so now the gender filter continues with each page change!

<h2>Day 39</h2>
<h4>May 16, 2020</h4>

Really happy with the progress I made with [this project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API) today, I implement a filter feature for gender for all the users within the GoRest API that I'm using for my webpage, tomorrow I plan on trying to implement a user inputted age range too

<h2>Day 38</h2>
<h4>May 15, 2020</h4>

Due to my high amount of coding time with projects and learning Java this week, my family time has been cut short so taking the day to hang with them but [I did finally start getting all my beginner code onto GitHub](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Learning-the-Basics), I'll add a new repo each day!

<h2>Day 37</h2>
<h4>May 14, 2020</h4>

FINALLY all thanks to my teacher for helping me figure out why we couldnt get a POST request to go through, authorization and Bearer tokens are what I learned about today. But also [finished up most recent API project!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API) More Java and Algorithms next

<h2>Day 36</h2>
<h4>May 13, 2020</h4>

Worked hours on the [latest project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API)
, trying to implement a POST request with user inputs and selected data. Did lots of research on understanding the request header data for API requests. Worked on updating my READMEs as well.

<h2>Day 35</h2>
<h4>May 12, 2020</h4>

Custom user snippets are amazing! Just stumbled upon the idea and made some today, so helpful. As for coding, I completed some [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms), spent more time on learning Java, and [completed a big portion of code on latest class project.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API)

<h2>Day 34</h2>
<h4>May 11, 2020</h4>

After failing to run Java within VSCode so I could practice while learning, I found a free Java compiler IDE online that'll be perfect! I finished the styling for [my last project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE), and class tonight we [started another with a different API!](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/GoREST%20API)

Pushed some [algorithms](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorithms) to my GitHub but am looking forward to styling/finishing up this most recent class project!

<h2>Day 32</h2>
<h4>May 9, 2020</h4>

The 30 Days Java was more than I could handle so instead I decided to go start the [SoloLearn course](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/16421537/Java) instead, getting a lot out of it, then I'll do the 30 Day again after! Started adding CSS to my current [project using CRUD](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE)

<h2>Day 31</h2>
<h4>May 8, 2020</h4>

Didn't get as much as I wanted down but am happy with my progress on my [newest project.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE) Allowing the user to make an edit on a post on the webpage and have the respective API request made depending on their inputs. CSS will be tomorrow's task

<h2>Day 30</h2>
<h4>May 7, 2020</h4>

Today's been a blast, started a 30 Day Java Challenge to begin learning Java, class tonight I learned how to use the [DELETE request method](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20PATCH%20DELETE), and am now getting some practice with Local Storage/Session Storage! Thankful for this blessing of code

<h4>May 6, 2020</h4>

Spent hours working on a [project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Working%20With%20CRUD/PUT%20n%20PATCH) that allows the user to change post data by a form, then had to make code logic that allowed my program to determine wether to make a PATCH or PUT request to the API. Learned some new techniques today for sure

<h2>Day 28</h2>
<h4>May 5, 2020</h4>

Pused some [intermediate algorithms to GitHub](https://github.com/ChristianPari/Algorthims/tree/master/intermediate%20alrogithms), spent the night with the class learning about more API methods [PUT and PATCH.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/First%20Put-Patch%20Request) Have a good understanding of their similarities and differences, will be using JSONplaceholder API for a project tomorrow

<h2>Day 27</h2>
<h4>May 4, 2020</h4>

More of my favorite, learned about [POST requests today and in a small webpage played around with gathering user input and sending it through as a parameter in a XHR POST request.](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/First%20APIs/First%20Post%20Request) Tomorrow's plan is to learn about the other XHR methods, can't wait!

<h2>Day 26</h2>
<h4>May 3, 2020</h4>

[Finished the functionality of the weather webpage](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Weather%20Webpage), I've incorporated 3 APIs and used 4 different endpoints, this definitely was the most in depth JS project I've done with APIs! All that's left is CSS tomorrow before class

<h2>Day 24</h2>
<h4>May 1, 2020</h4>

Today I started another [Weather API project using multiple APIs](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Weather%20Webpage), this will have two UIs which allows users to get today's current weather anywhere in the world and another will allow them to get weather from the last 20 years from any location

<h2>Day 23</h2>
<h4>April 30, 2020</h4>

In the process of finishing up the styling of this [Historical Weather API](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Historical%20Weather), once done I'll be recreating it from scratch over the weekend and implementing another API into the code as well to get practice using more than one API source! 

<h2>Day 22</h2>
<h4>April 29, 2020</h4>

Worked more on the [Meteostat Historical Weather API project](https://github.com/ChristianPari/APIs/tree/master/Weather/Historical%20Weather), implemented a cancel button, and displayed the response data from the API to the DOM.
